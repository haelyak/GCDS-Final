#Preparing

```{r cars}
GS <- readr::read_csv("GCDS22_11-15_numeric.csv")

GS <- general_survey1115 %>% 
  select(., -Status, -IPAddress, )

LoveLetter <- readr::read_csv("LoveLetter_11-15_choice.csv")


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
